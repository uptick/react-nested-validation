    <h1>Live Demo</h1>
  </div>

  <p>To participate in the demonstration you will need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Javascript enabled</li>
    <li>A modern browser</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All examples given are written with babel loaders to support es6 (stage-0) and JSX syntax.</p>

  <h2>Basic Example</h2>
  <p>In the basic example we are interested in populating data about a movie; the title
    and the year. In this case we need a single form, and a presentational component. We'll validate
    that the data has a title.</p>
  <p>Below the form inputs you'll see the current value of the `form` prop passed to the
    form's `onChange` handler.</p>

  <code class="script" data-source="{{ site.baseurl }}/basic/forms.js">Loading...</code>
  <code class="script" data-source="{{ site.baseurl }}/basic/components.js">Loading...</code>

  <h2>Nested Example</h2>
  <p>In this example we show how two different forms can be combined into one. This helps
    with resusability of form validations. We have a form designed to validate a person, and
    our previous movie form. By combining them we can capitalise on them in many locations. In
    this instance we'll add a director to the movie.</p>
  <div class="demo-nested"></div>
  <code class="script" data-source="{{ site.baseurl }}/nested/forms.js">Loading...</code>
  <code class="script" data-source="{{ site.baseurl }}/nested/components.js">Loading...</code>

  <h2>Array Example</h2>
  <p>In a more complicated example, we'll take the same setup as for the nested example, but
    add a list of actors, also using the `PersonForm`.</p>
  <p>This example also includes some form level validation. The form will generate a warning
    when the user has entered the move title "Jaws".</p>
  <div class="demo-array"></div>
  <code class="script" data-source="{{ site.baseurl }}/array/forms.js">Loading...</code>
  <code class="script" data-source="{{ site.baseurl }}/array/components.js">Loading...</code>

</div>
